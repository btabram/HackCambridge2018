"""palmPositionToSound.py

Written on 20/01 by Will Grant, TomÃ© Gouveia and Brett Abram

Takes stdin giving the palm position from the Leap Motion
Input form:
(x, y, z)

Outputs a sine wave with frequency proportional to the y position.

Currently the difference between the input polling rate and sample rate
results in lag: currently trying to fix.
